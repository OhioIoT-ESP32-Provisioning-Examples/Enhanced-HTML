```


### Getting Started - PlatformIO
- Compile and run

### Getting Started - Arduino IDE 
- copy ***/src/main.cpp*** into a new sketch ***prov_lab/prov_lab.ino*** (or whatever name you choose) in your Arduino projects folder
- copy the ***lib/provisioner*** folder into your ***libraries/*** folder in your Arduino projects folder
- Compile and run

## Updates

**10/17/25** - Adding some logging when the provisioner starts

**10/18/25** - WiFi.begin() will put the WiFi in WIFI_STA mode automatically if it comes from WIFI_OFF.  However, if the device is coming from WIFI_AP mode, WiFi.begin() will apparently put it in WIFI_AP_STA mode, and leave the DEVICE_PROVISIONING SSID active.  So, best to explicitly call WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA) before WiFi.begin() (see _src/main.cpp_).
